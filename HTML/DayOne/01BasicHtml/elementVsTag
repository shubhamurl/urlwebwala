HTML Elements vs. Tags
ðŸ”¹ Tags:The instructions surrounded by angle brackets: <h1>, </p>, <img>.
        Tags come in pairs (opening and closing) or can be self-closing.

Example:<b>Hello</b>
<b> is an opening tag.
</b> is a closing tag.

âœ… Some tags are self-closing (do not have separate closing tags):
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<br>
<hr>

Elements:Everything from the opening tag to the closing tag, including the content.
Example:<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Here, the whole line is an element.

Think of it this way:
Tag: instruction
Element: the full package (tag + content)
